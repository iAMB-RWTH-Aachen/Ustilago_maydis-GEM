# Generation of a genome scale metabolic model for Ustilago maydis - more than causative agent of corn smut

Here we present a genome-scale stoichiometric model (GEM) for Ustilago maydis. In a first step, a genome-scale network reconstruction (GENRE) based on the genome sequence and available physiological data was created using the automatic reconstruction software Pathway Tools. After extensive manual curation, this GENRE served as basis for generation of the GEM iCL1079. The model includes 1987 metabolites linked by 2218 reactions (1658 conversion reactions, 560 transport processes), which spread across the four included compartments :Extracellular, Cytosol, Mitochondrial Lumen, and Mitochondrial Intermembrane Space. The contained 1079 genes are assigned to 86% of the reactions.In addition, we are testing growth at 190 different carbon sources to be able to reconcile experimental behaviour and model prediction.
